# Climate Awareness

## 🔥 Inspiration

Climatic change has become a global concern over the last few decades. Besides, these climatic changes affect life on the earth in various ways. These climatic changes are having various impacts on the ecosystem and ecology. Due to these changes, a number of species of plants and animals have gone extinct.

We as humans only think about anything when we ourselves see the impact, so we thought of showing visuals of the climate change we have caused till now. _We hope this project helps in raising awareness in people about the climatic conditions so that they do care about such issues..._

## ❓ What it does

This site delivers up-to-date information about the earth's current temperature, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and worldwide news and articles about global warming and deforestation.

## 🛠 How we built it

We used an API to collect data regarding climate change, Methane levels, melted polar ice caps, and used Chartjs to visualize the retrieved data and present them on our website. We used **Html**, **CSS** for the front-end, **Node.js**, **Express** for the backend and deployed the project in **Google Cloud**.

## 🦾 Challenges we ran into

- We faced difficulty in getting the data from the API targetting only the required things and displaying them in the chart.
- Integrating Chartjs into the web app gave us some trouble.
- Deploying an app in Google Cloud and adding a custom domain for the first time was very challenging for us.
- When we tried to add automatic deployment to the repo it kept on failing.

## 🐱‍🏍 Accomplishments that we're proud of

This is our first Hackathon and even after facing these many problems, after spending lots of time in StackOverflow and random googling, we successfully completed our project and deployed it into the web which we're very proud of.

## 📑 What we learned

- We learned how to divide our work and do it as a team.
- Although we were learning new stuff, we never used to implement them (maybe because of FOMO), this hackathon gave us a chance to know what we could do.
- Mainly we realized that we have to participate in Hackathons more often 😄.

## 📢 What's next for Save Earth Save Us

1. We need to improve the UI
2. Add a few more APIs that would give updates with the latest news regarding climate changes.
3. Make it more user-friendly.
